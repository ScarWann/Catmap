# The catmap project

## The theory

### What's a catmap?

What I call a catmap is a generalized version of the discrete Arnold's cat map, a transformation that is defined by the formulas
$`x_{n+1} = (2x_n + y_n)mod X`$ and
$`y_{n+1} = (x_n + y_n) mod X`$. This project, however, uses a much more generalized definition:
$`x_{n+1} = f(x_n, y_n) mod X`$ and
$`y_{n+1} = g(x_n, y_n) mod Y`$. Notice how the second X is replaced by another value, Y, which causes the map to lose some of its normally chaotic properties under certain conditions, which is not describe
